This project is used as a notification system for MadCamp. 

Since the sessions are spread out all over the place, attendees can signup
to receive text notifications about upcoming sessions. The data is read out
of the Google spreadsheet used as the primary scheduling grid.

In addition, attendees can text in feedback for each speaker that can be
aggregated and presented in the browser or forwarded via email.

This is an App Engine project written in Python and utilizes Twilio for 
SMS communication and the GData API for Google Docs integration.

What else should we do with this?
